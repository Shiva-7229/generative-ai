What is AI?
    The power of a machine to copy Intelligent Human Behaviour

Types of AI 
    1. Narrow Intelligence
    2. General Intelligence
    3. Super Intelligence

Narrow Intelligence:
    Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI) is AI that specializes in one area. It is machine Intelligence that equals 
    or exceeds Human Intelligence or efficiency but in one specific area. Smartphone apps, Spam filters, google
    translate and google search are all examples of ANI.

General Intelligence:
    Artificial General Intelligence refers to a computer that is as smart as a human across the board and that can 
    perform any intellectual task that a human being can do.

Super Intelligence:
    Artificial Super Intelligence is an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically
    every field, including scientific field, general wisdom and social skills.

Artificial Intelligence vs Machine Learning vs Deep Learning
    AI ==> Artificial Intelligence is the ability of a computer to perform tasks commonly associated with
    Intelligent beings. (John McCarthy - 1956)

    ML ==> Machine Learning is the study of algorithms that learn from examples and experiences instead of relying
    on hard-coded rules and make predictions on new data. (Arthur Samuel - 1959)

    DL ==> Deep Learning is a subfield of Machine Learning focusing on Learning data representations as 
    successive layers of increasingly meaningfull representations.

    "Traditional Machine Learning"
    cat.jpg ---> hand crafted features ------------------> learned classifier ---> cat

    Deep "end - to - end" Learning:
                learned       learned       learned
    cat.jpg --> low-level --> mid-level --> high-level --> learned classifier --> cat
                features      features      features

Milestones of AI
    1936 --> Turing Machine
    1956 --> The History begins: The term "AI" is coined
    1966 --> Birth of the first chatbot
    1972 --> AI enters the Medical field
    1986 --> "NETtalk" program speaks
    1997 --> Computer beats world chess champion
    2011 --> AI enters everyday life
    2018 --> AI debates space travel
    20xx --> The near future is Intelligent

    --> Eblue --> first AI --> developed by IBM

Steps of AI
    1. Reasoning
    2. Semantic Content
    3. Knowledge mapping
    4. Language 
    5. Perception
    6. Narrow AI
    7. General AI
    8. Strong AI

The Turing Test
    1950 --> Alan Turing devised a test for Intelligence called the Imitation Game.

    Examples of AI:
        1. Autonomous cars 
        2. Chat bot
        3. Drones
        4. Human vs Computer Game
        5. Robot

Advantages of AI
    The most important purpose of AI is to reduse human casualities in 
        --> Wars
        --> Dangerous Workspaces
        --> Car Accidents
        --> Natural Disasters
            or to make everyday life easier by helping with tasks such as:
                --> Cleaning
                --> Shopping
                --> Transportation

DisAdvantages of AI
    --> Increased costs
    --> Difficult with software development slow and expensive
    --> Few experienced programmers
    --> Few practical products have reached the market as yet
