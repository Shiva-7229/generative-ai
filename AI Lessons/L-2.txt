Applications:
    1. Face Recognition
        --> Face Detection
        --> Feature Extraction
        --> System Training
        --> Classification
    2. Eyeball Detection and Tracking
        --> Detecting Eyes on the Face
    3. Object Detection and Tracking 
        --> RCNN 
    4. Medicine
        --> Image Guided Surgery
        --> Image analysis and Enhancement
    5. Fruit, Flower and Car Counting
        --> It work on top of object Detection
        --> Camera should be moving and object should be fixed
        --> It works with the horizontal and vertical axis
        --> Can be extended to count the cars in the parking lot, traffic flow on any signal for the traffic
            management, people count to find the footfall in the shopping mall etc.
    6. Games
